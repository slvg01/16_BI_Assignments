# 📊 Power BI / DAX Showcase  

Welcome to this repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my work on **Power BI** and **DAX**.  
The objective is to demonstrate my **data modeling** and **BI reporting** **capabilities** as they are now, **in full transparency**.  
But I am **eager to learn** much more 😃 and I am a **fast learner** 😎 🚀 🎯!!!!

## 📂 Contents  
This repository contains **three Power BI reports** in **PDF format**, each tackling different analytical objectives:  

### 1️⃣ **Human Resources Monitoring**  
A dynamic dashboard designed to track HR performance against objectives and detect mid-term operational deviations. It provides insights into:  
- **Headcount & FTE trends**: Entry rates, turnover rates by department and category.  
- **Workforce hours distribution**: Breakdown by nature (paid/unpaid, worked/non-worked, sickness, delegation, leaves, etc.).  
- **Hourly productivity at points of sale**.  

### 2️⃣ **Product Strategy Review**  
A dashboard created at the request of the **strategy department** to evaluate the company's **product portfolio** in relation to its **contribution to overall margin** and **sales volumes**.  

To achieve this, the report presents:  
- Two **matrix visualization** that classifies products based on their profitability and volume impact (one in a tbale one graphical).  
- A **heatmap** that highlights product performance patterns across key business dimensions.  
- A **summary figures page**, providing a high-level overview of the key financial and operational takeaways.  

This structured approach in the end allowed stakeholders to quickly prioritize products to make informed strategic decisions.  

### 3️⃣ **Point of Sales Productivity**  
A report designed to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency:  
- **Hourly resource allocation vs. sales & activity**: Includes a **heatmap** for better visualization.  
- **Productivity benchmarking** across different restaurant locations.  

### 4️⃣ **Strategy Engineering Report**  
A tool for **product strategy evaluation** and operational planning. It analyzes product performance from two key perspectives:  
- **Profit contributors**: Volume vs. profitability (margin analysis).  
- **Velocity drivers**: Sales volume vs. time of day.
